#The following transformations were applied to the source data:
  
  #The training and test sets were merged to create one data set.

  #The measurements on the mean and standard deviation (i.e. signals containing the strings mean and std) were extracted for each measurement, and the others were discarded.

  #The activity identifiers (originally coded as integers between 1 and 6) were replaced with descriptive activity names (see Identifiers section).

  #The variable names were replaced with descriptive variable names (e.g. tBodyAcc-mean()-X was expanded to timeDomainBodyAccelerometerMeanX), using the following set of rules:
  
      #Special characters (i.e. (, ), and -) were removed

      #The initial f and t were expanded to frequencyDomain and timeDomain respectively.

      #Acc, Gyro, Mag, Freq, mean, and std were replaced with Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnitude, Frequency, Mean, and StandardDeviation respectively.

      #Replaced (supposedly incorrect as per source's features_info.txt file) BodyBody with Body.

  #From the data set in step 4, the final data set was created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#The collection of the source data and the transformations listed above were implemented by the run_analysis.R R script (see README.md file for usage instructions).
